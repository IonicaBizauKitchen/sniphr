Why?

- text extraction diagram goes here


What is Sniphr?
===============

- a crowdsourced document analyzer
- an FRD lasso
- opt-in spyware
- a passive bookmarking tool

The New Paradigm
================

``` ruby
def mullet_architecture
  party = "javascript"
  business = "JSON API"
	"#{party} in the front, #{business} in the back"
end
```

The Client
==========

- Nothing but static JS/HTML
- As low-level/general purpose/agnostic as possible.
- Options window is a remote iframe

Privacy
=======

- Privacy is important to people. Does a domain whitelist solve this?
- many covert http requests (facebook, imdb, ad networks: https://gist.github.com/933620)

Oh, Auth.
=========

- What is OAuth? Let's ask sniphr: [sniphr.com/sniphs?q=OAuth](http://sniphr.com/sniphs?q=OAuth)
- All the [cool kids](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) are doing it.
- Essential for Javascript-powered apps (mobile, web-based)
- Wordnik should be doing it

Roadmap
=======

- highlight my sniphs on a page
- highlight all sniphs on a page
- allow users to manually check for sniphs on a page
- allow users to manually sniph outside their whitelisted domains
- sniph-enabling or sniph-disabling keypress option

Colophon
========
