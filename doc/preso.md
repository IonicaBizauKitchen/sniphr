Mullet Architecture
===================

	party = javascript
	
	business = JSON API
	
	{party} in the front, {business} in the back

Privacy
=======

- Privacy is important to people. Does a domain whitelist solve this?
- users hit thousands of URLs each day
- many covert http requests (most queried domains: https://gist.github.com/933620)

Oh, Auth.
=========

- What is OAuth? Let's ask sniphr: [sniphr.com/sniphs?q=OAuth](http://sniphr.com/sniphs?q=OAuth)
- All the [cool kids](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) are doing it.
- Essential for Javascript-powered apps (mobile, web-based)
- Wordnik should be doing it

Roadmap
=======

- highlight my sniphs on a page
- highlight all sniphs on a page
- allow users to manually check for sniphs on a page
- allow users to manually sniph outside their whitelisted domains
- sniph-enabling or sniph-disabling keypress option
