The Nose Knows
==============

![Nose](http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/19100/19107/nose_19107_lg.gif)

- passive bookmarking
- 

Mullet Architecture
===================

	party = javascript
	
	business = JSON API
	
	{party} in the front, {business} in the back

Sniphware
=========

- Privacy is important to people. Does a whitelist solve this?
- users hit thousands of URLs each day
- many covert http requests (most queried domains: https://gist.github.com/933620)

Roadmap
=======

- *real* user auth/integration
- give users their own domain white/black lists
- highlight my sniphs on a page
- highlight all sniphs on a page
- sniphr.com should be blacklisted
- save "instance number" if selected text occurs multiple times on the page?
- allow users to manually check for sniphs on a page

Oh, Auth.
=========

- What is OAuth? Let's ask sniphr: [sniphr.com/sniphs?q=OAuth](http://sniphr.com/sniphs?q=OAuth)
- All the [cool kids](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) are doing it.
- Essential for Javascript-powered apps (mobile, web-based)
- Wordnik should be doing it
